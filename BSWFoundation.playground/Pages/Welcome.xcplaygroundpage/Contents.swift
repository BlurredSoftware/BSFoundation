 Welcome to BSWFoundation!

 These are collection of types that are use throughout all TheLeftBit's iOS projects and that allow us to write better apps, faster.
 
 - important: Please build the scheme `BSWFoundationPlayground` before executing anything on this Playground

 This project leverages heavily on Swift's [core features](https://swift.org/about/), so you have to be very profficient with these in order to understand why this types are so important.
 
 This Playground will guide you through the most useful classes available in this module. **It is recommended** that you go trough them in order, since each one builds on top of a concept learned in the previous chapter.
